# QtTerminalWidget
QTermWidget is an opensource project originally based on KDE4 Konsole application,
but it took its own direction later.
The main goal of this project is to provide unicode-enabled, embeddable
Qt widget for using as a built-in console (or terminal emulation widget).

# Install
You can obtain qtterminalwidget as a pod. See here for reference:
https://github.com/cybercatalyst/qt-pods

# Current transition
As a KDE project, QTermWidget used cmake traditionally. It has been switched
over to qmake by Jacob Dawid <jacob@omg-it.works> to be compatible with qt-pods.
Help us to make the transition complete.

Until before the transition, the project was maintained by Petr Vanek.
